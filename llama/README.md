# LLaMA 

This repository is intended as a minimal, hackable and readable example to load [LLaMA](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/) ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971v1)) models and run inference.
In order to download the checkpoints and tokenizer, fill this [google form](https://forms.gle/jk851eBVbX1m5TAv5)

## Setup

In a conda env with pytorch / cuda available, run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then in this repository:
```
pip install -e .
```

## Download

Once your request is approved, you will receive links to download the tokenizer and model files.
Edit the `download.sh` script with the signed url provided in the email to download the model weights and tokenizer.

## Inference

The provided `example.py` can be run on a single or multi-gpu node with `torchrun` and will output completions for two pre-defined prompts. Using `TARGET_FOLDER` as defined in `download.sh`:
```
torchrun --nproc_per_node MP example.py --ckpt_dir $TARGET_FOLDER/model_size --tokenizer_path $TARGET_FOLDER/tokenizer.model
```

Different models require different MP values:

|  Model | MP |
|--------|----|
| 7B     | 1  |
| 13B    | 2  |
| 33B    | 4  |
| 65B    | 8  |

## FAQ
